## Windows Application – “Game Point Change”
This was a course project developed using Visual Studio 2022 as the IDE and VB.NET as the programming language, with Microsoft Access as the database.
The project remained incomplete as it was a final course assignment with limited time for further development. After this project, I shifted my focus to learning other programming languages.
